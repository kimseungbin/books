# Books

In this repository, I curate and summarize a collection of CS and Programming-related books. Reading and coding along with these books is an essential part of the learning process, but true master often requires more. **This repository is my approach to thoroughly digesting and distilling the key insights, concepts and practical knowledge from these books.** Join me on this journey of exploration and discovery as we uncover the essence of each book's wisdom.

# Tips

1. Use GitHub's `Table of Contents` function to navigate.
# Rules

1. Quotes that are not explicitly cited are assumed to originated from the books themselves.
