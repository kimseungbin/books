## What is Test-Driven Development?

> Test-driven development is a technique for designing and structuring code that that encourages simplicity and increases one's confidence in code, even as its size increases.

To further divide and conquer the definition...

### A technique

This technique is borne of a set of beliefs about code

- Simplicity: The art of maximizing the amount of work *not* done, is essential.

  In other words, TDD encourages developers to keep their code as simple and minimal as possible, avoiding unnecessary complexity.

  This aligns with the idea that doing less (not doing unnecessary work) is essential in software development because it leads to more maintainable, efficient, and less error-prone code.

- Obviousness and Clarity are more virtuous than cleverness

- Writing uncluttered code is a key component of being successful

### Designing and Structuring Code

TDD is not fundamentally about testing code. The purpose of TDD is to improve the design and structure of the code.

### A Bias Toward Simplicity

Simplicity isn't esoteric. In software, it can be measured.

- Fewer lines of code per feature
- Lower cyclomatic complexity
- Fer side effects
- Smaller runtime or memory requirements

The act of writing the test first acts as a forcing function -- compelling us to deal with arbitrary complexity early.

### Increased Confidence

TDD increases the confidence in code because each new test flexes the system in new and previously untested ways.0
