# Books

In this repository, I curate and summarize a collection of CS and Programming-related books. Reading and coding along with these books is an essential part of the learning process, but true master often requires more. **This repository is my approach to thoroughly digesting and distilling the key insights, concepts and practical knowledge from these books.** Join me on this journey of exploration and discovery as we uncover the essence of each book's wisdom.

# Tips

1. Use GitHub's `Table of Contents` function to navigate.
# Rules

1. Quotes that are not explicitly cited are assumed to originated from the books themselves.

> If you’re looking to develop native applications in Kubernetes, this is your guide. Developers and AppOps administrators will learn how to build Kubernetes-native applications that interact directly with the API server to query or update the state of resources. AWS developer advocate Michael Hausenblas and Red Hat principal software engineer Stefan Schimanski explain the characteristics of these apps and show you how to program Kubernetes to build them.
