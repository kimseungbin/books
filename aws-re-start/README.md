## Cloud Concepts

### Introduction to cloud computing

Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of computer power, database, storage, applications, and other IT resources via
the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.

Traditional computing model: infrastructure as hardware

Cloud computing model: Infrastructure as software

Cloud service models

- IaaS: More control over IT resources; highest level of control.

- On-premises (private cloud)

### Advantages of cloud computing

1. Trade capital expense for variable expense: pay-as-you-go pricing
2. Massive economies of scale
3. Stop guessing capacity
4. Increase speed and agility
5. Stop spending money on running and maintaining data center
